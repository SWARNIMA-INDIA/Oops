        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming is a programming model where you define classes as blueprints to create objects that bundle related data and functions together. This allows you to organize code by modeling real-world entities, like a \"Student\" or \"Car,\" rather than just writing loose lists of instructions.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class acts as a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the common attributes and methods that all objects of that type will possess. For example, a \"Car\" class would define the general properties and behaviors of all cars, while individual \"myCar\" or \"yourCar\" objects would be specific instances of that class with unique values for their attributes. For example - \"myCar\" is red, \"yourCar\" is blue.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - Objects: These are the fundamental building blocks of OOP. An object represents a real-world entity, like a car, a person, or a bank account. Each object has:\n",
        "    - Attributes (Data): These are the properties that describe the object.\n",
        "     For example - a car's color, speed, or model.\n",
        "    - Methods (Behaviors): These are the actions the object can perform.\n",
        "     For example - a car can accelerate, brake, or turn.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction means showing only the important features of an object and hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "  - Encapsulation means binding data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to the data.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods (also called magic methods) are special built-in methods in Python whose names begin and end with double underscores, such as _init, __str, __len_, etc. These methods allow a class to define how its objects should behave with built-in operations and functions. Python automatically calls these methods during actions like object creation, printing, addition, comparison, and indexing. They help custom classes behave like built-in data types.\n",
        "  - For example:\n",
        "     - _init_() → initializes an object\n",
        "     - _str_() → defines what is shown when we print the object\n",
        "     - _len_() → allows the object to work with len()\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the child or subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (data members and methods) of another class (called the parent or superclass).It helps in reusing existing code and extending it without rewriting it.\n",
        "  - Through inheritance, the child class can:\n",
        "     - Use the features of the parent class\n",
        "     - Add new features\n",
        "     - Modify existing features\n",
        "7. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to the internal data of a class and allowing modification only through methods.\n",
        "  - Python provides this protection using private, protected, and public access specifiers.\n",
        "    - Public Members- Can be accessed from anywhere.Example: normal variables and methods.\n",
        "    -  Protected Members (_variable) - Indicated by a single underscore.Should not be accessed directly outside the class (by convention).\n",
        "    - Private Members (__variable) - Indicated by double underscore.\n",
        "   Cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.Python internally name-mangles them to prevent direct access.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize the objects of a class. It runs automatically whenever a new object is created.\n",
        "  - In Python, the constructor is defined using the _init_() method.\n",
        "  - The main purpose of a constructor is to assign initial values to object attributes and set up the object's state.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - A class method is a method that operates on the class rather than on individual objects. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first parameter. Class methods can access and modify class-level variables. They can be called using the class name as well as an object.\n",
        "  - A static method is a method that does not depend on the class or object. It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator and does not take self or cls as a parameter. Static methods cannot access instance or class variables directly and are mainly used for utility or helper functions inside a class.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading means having one method name that can work in different ways depending on how many arguments you give it.Python does not support true method overloading like other languages. If you define the same method name again, the new definition replaces the old one.However, Python allows a similar behaviour by using default parameters.\n",
        "  - This means a single method can be written in such a way that it works even if you provide one, two, or more arguments.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding happens when a child class provides its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class.The overridden method in the child class replaces the parent class method when called through a child object.This is used to change or extend the behavior of the parent class method.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - A property decorator in Python (@property) is used when you want to access a method like it's a normal variable.Instead of calling a function with parentheses, you can write it like an attribute, and Python will run the method for you.\n",
        "  - It is mainly used when you want to protect or control how a value is returned, but still keep the code clean and easy to read.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism allows one method name to perform different tasks depending on the object that calls it. This makes the program more flexible in how it handles different data types.\n",
        "  - It reduces code duplication because the same method can be reused in many classes with different implementations.\n",
        "  - It makes the program easier to extend, since new classes can be added with their own versions of a method without changing the existing code.\n",
        "  - It improves readability and clean structure, as common behavior is grouped under one method name, making the code easier to understand.\n",
        "  - It supports maintainability, because changes in one class do not affect the rest of the program as long as the method name remains the same\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that acts as a template and cannot be created directly. It contains methods without full definitions, and any class that inherits from it must provide the actual implementation of those methods.In Python, we use the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator to create abstract classes.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Reusability - You can reuse classes and methods in different programs, saving time and effort.\n",
        "  - Better Organization - Code is grouped into objects, making programs cleaner and easier to understand.\n",
        "  - Easy to Maintain - Changes in one part of the program don't affect the whole system, so updates are easier.\n",
        "  - Encapsulation - Data is protected inside objects, reducing errors and improving security.\n",
        "  - Inheritance - You can create new classes using existing ones, which reduces code duplication.\n",
        "  - Polymorphism - The same function name can behave differently for different objects, making code more flexible.\n",
        "  - Real-world Modeling - OOP makes it easier to represent real-life entities in code.\n",
        "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit features (methods and attributes) from more than one parent class at the same time. This allows a child class to combine the behavior of multiple classes into one.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - A class variable is shared by all objects of the class. It is defined inside the class but outside any method. Changing it affects every object that uses it.\n",
        "  - An instance variable belongs to each individual object. It is defined inside the _init_() method. Changing it affects only that specific object, not others.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__' methods in Python.\n",
        "  - The _str_() method provides a human-readable and user-friendly string representation of an object. It is mainly used when the object is printed, and its purpose is to display information in a clear and simple way.\n",
        "  - The _repr_() method provides a developer-friendly, more detailed string representation of an object. Its main purpose is debugging, and it ideally returns a string that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call a parent class's methods from within a child class. It helps in reusing and extending the parent class's functionality without rewriting code. It is especially useful in inheritance, ensuring proper method resolution and making the code cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. It is automatically executed when an object is about to be destroyed or its memory is being freed. The main significance of the _del_ method is that it allows you to clean up resources, such as closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from a database before the object is removed.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - A @staticmethod is a method that does not take self or cls as an argument. It behaves like a normal function inside a class and cannot access or modify class or instance variables. It is used when the method is related to the class but does not need any class or object data.\n",
        "  - A @classmethod, on the other hand, takes cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself. It can access and modify class variables and can be used to create alternative constructors or perform operations related to the class as a whole.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance works by allowing child classes to override parent class methods so that the same method call behaves differently depending on which object is used.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another. This works when each method returns the object itself (return self). It makes the code cleaner and more readable.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. When a class defines __call__, its instances can be used with parentheses, just like calling a function. This is useful for creating objects that behave like functions or for implementing customizable behavior when the object is \"called.\""
